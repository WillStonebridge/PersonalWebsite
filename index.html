    <h2 class="sectionHead">- About -</h2>

    <p class="sectionText">James William Stonebridge, who goes by Will, is a Sophomore at Purdue University pursuing a
        degree in the Electrical and Computer Engineering College. Assuming his brain does not explode in the next three
        years, he is set to graduate in 2024.<br><br>

        Will has programmed with seven different languages, both inside and outside the classroom. In his free
        time, he taught himself the HTML, CSS and Javascript necessary to run the very website you are
        on right now!<br><br>

        Over the past four years, there has hardly been a moment when Will was not working with a team or developing
        leadership skills. He has been selected to lead two clubs as President, competed daily with two athletic Teams
        and been nominated to Officer Training at the US Naval Academy. Furthermore, his reviews on group projects -
        which are available below - are proof that he is at least somewhat likeable.<br><br>

        As a Student, Will earned straight As during his first semester and maintains a position on the Engineering Dean's
        List. He is a semester ahead of his peers in Physics and a year ahead in Mathematics. He keeps a Chicago Cubs
        W Flag near his desk to remind him that sometimes it only takes 108 years of failure (and maybe Kris Bryant) to
        succeed.<br><br>

        Despite his professor's best efforts, Will occasionally finds time to pursue his hobbies. Whether it's learning
        Roman History, playing Guitar or brushing up on his Japanese, Will finds passion in teaching himself new things.
        <br><br>

        Will Stonebridge has done quite a bit. Hopefully, he can work for you next.</p>

            Will is on top of the work he is required to do whenever it is given to him and goes out of his way to do
            additional work so that the team can be successful. He gives assistance to other group members and uses his
            knowledge to help his own work as well as others. He also is very proficient at picking up new skills in order to
            improve the overall quality of the group work.<br><br>

            Will is an excellent team member. He is always focused on the task at hand and ensures that progress is being made
            on all fronts. My only recommendation would be for Will to insert himself as more of a leading role, as this would
            suit his talents perfectly. Will is a reliable teammate who never fails to ensure his work is done on time and to
            a high degree of quality.<br><br>

            Will was a great teammate and very good at collaborating together and finding when there is a problem. Will had many
            useful skills with the content we have been working on in class, and it has been very useful. If there was anything
            he could work on it would be encouraging his fellow teammates for success. Overall, he was a great teammate and
            surpassed every category he could've, always did more than he needed to do to get the job done.<br><br>

            Will is always responsible for his parts and has been helping others throughout the whole semester. He always
            motivates others to do better work. The team would not be able to work so smoothly without him, and he is constantly
            giving us wonderful suggestions and reminding us what needs to be completed. I really enjoy working with him this
            semester. He is a great leader!<br><br>
